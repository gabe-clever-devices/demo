## Notes
Hi! I've responded to your coding task in the form of a console application. If you execute it without a command switch (`-reverse` or `-intersect`), or with less than three arguments, you'll get usage instructions.

For the sentence reversal requirement, I'm treating all arguments (after the first) as the sentence.

For the stack implementation requirement, I've implemented a generic stack class, and I've used it to perform the sentence reversal.

```
Examples

to reverse arguments:

  clever-devices.exe -reverse arg1 arg2 ... argN

  output:
    argN ... arg2 arg1

to perform string intersection:

  clever-devices.exe -intersect asdf asdx

  output:
    asd
```

### On style
I know people can get really worked up about tabs versus spaces, whitespace between an "if" and an open parenthesis, etc. I have my own preferences, but I'm really not attached. What I definitely **am** is very happy to follow coding standards that work for the team I'm on.

Thanks for taking a look!
